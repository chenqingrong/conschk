# A simple demo to teach how to do configuration analysis using Soot

`cdemo` is perhaps the simplest demo I can think of to show how to build configuration analysis tools for Java programs using Soot.

The demo does nothing but prints out the entry points of configuration values.

There is no doc for this demo, because it is just too simple,
and as a part of learning you are required to read every line of code.

We highly suggest you to place the `src` in a modern Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ or Eclipse);
you will need to use the jars in `lib`;
to try out the analysis, you can use the codebase in `app`.
